                        <p>Today we celebrate you,<br>
                            The heart of our family, strong and true.<br>

                        <p>Thank you for caring for our sweet Abby too,<br>
                            Through all the storms she’s journeyed through—<br>
                            Her health, her cries, her restless days,<br>
                            You’ve held her close in countless ways.</p>

                        <p>Even with your own battles fought,<br>
                            You gave her—and us—more than we thought.<br>
                            Your courage shines through every test,<br>
                            And in my eyes, you are the best.</p>

                        <p>No words could ever quite convey<br>
                            How much you're cherished every day.<br>
                            You are an incredible mother and more—<br>
                            The soul of our home, the heart at its core.</p>
